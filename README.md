## About Van Life

Van Life is a website for travelers who want to take their trip to the road! The idea is that 
users can pick from a wide variety of vans to rent and even host vans of their own. The mission 
is to enliven road trips with the perfect travel van rental. Think of it
as an AirBnb for road trip enthusiasts.

This web application includes:
* A Home Page:    
* Host Page where users can see a Dashboard of their, income, vans, and reviews
  * Host Income Page where the user can see their total income and transactions
  * Host Vans Page where the user can see their listed vans
  * Host Reviews where the user can see their reviews           
* About Page       
* Vans Page where users can view all of the available vans and filter through type    
  * Van Detail Page when the user clicks on a van image   
* Login Page

### How Was it Made?

This app was made with React as the framework, React Router 6 to navigate between routes, 
Mirage.js for mock api calls, and CSS for frontend design.

## Quick start:

```
$ npm install
$ npm start
````

## How To Log In!

There is still no feature for users to create an account. However, I have
provided Log In credentials for the time being.
